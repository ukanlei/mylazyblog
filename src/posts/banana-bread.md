This recipe is oil-free, gluten-free, sugar-free, hassle-free, stress-free, dishwashing-free, and veganâ€”no need to turn on your oven or use any special tools. Instead, just grab a bowl and fork, mix the ingredients together, and pop it into the microwave. Within minutes, you will have a fibrous treat that your bowel movement will thank you for.

### Ingredients
2 to 3 Brown bananas\
1 to 2 cups of Instant oatmeal

### Instructions
1. Peel off and discard banana skin. Place banana in a microwave-safe bowl and use a fork to mash bananas until smooth, liquid-like form.
2. Add 1 cup of oatmeal. Stir to mix. Check the consistency of the mixture. If it is similar to liquid or custard, add more oatmeal. The end result should be 95% oatmeal and the rest banana.
3. Cover the bowl with a lid and place in the microwave for 2 minutes. Check to see if the bread has become a solid form. If not, microwave for another minute.
